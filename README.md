CM Engine is a game engine that I am creating to quickly develop and test 2D computer games. The engine uses SFML and should work across Mac, PC, and especially Linux. At the moment you cannot really use the engine to make anything since it's still in its early stages of development. The code is a mess, my makefiles are a cluster f*ck, and I'm still learning, so if you see something I did especially wrong, send me a pull request.
